Best process so far.

1. Cardboard
2. poke microcontroller pins through
3. using a pin poke holes for through hole components
4. Cover back with yeloow heat resistant Kaptan tape
5. get SMD components connected to breadboard pins or purchase modules with the MSD attached to boards.
6. use electrifi conducting filament and a 3D pen to print the traces. Could use a 3D Printer setup with the height adjusted. Possibly use the kaptan tape on the printer.
7. glue gun support components on the component side not the ttrace side yet
8. Use Bare conducting ink to connect the pins to the traces and heat dry or let dry
9. cover the pins and conducting ink with glue gun glue. Could cover the entire back of the board but looks better to see the traces
10. Test and check trace conductivity
